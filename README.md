# OP_Recipes
A repository for the "Recipes" HTML project in The Odin Project

This project aims to produce a simple web page which displays a list of recipes and links out to those recipes. 

This will develop the following skills:

- Producing HTML boilerplate in an unguided manner
- Linking practical information to a central homepage
- HTML formatting as this will require a number of paragraphs and potentially strong or emphasised formatting
