    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a gumbo that I've developed over the years, it's super simple, quick to make and ideal for feeding a diverse set of guests as it works on the basis of establishing a gravy and adding <em>"toppings"</em></p>

    <p>Toppings can be the standard chicken and sausage, to non-standard - such as aubergine or mushroom if you're serving to vegans or vegetarians.</p>

    <p>I like to operate on a "hot and quick" basis to creating the roux, and use Geesowska Kielbasa to substitute for Andouille - give it a go!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Makes approximately 6-8 portions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>100g vegetable oil</li>
        <li>120g plain flour</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>6 small bell peppers</li>
        <li>4 sticks of celery</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 small carrots</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Cajun seasoning (spicy)</li>
        <li>2 tsp Crystal hot sauce (or your favourite vinegar based hot sauce)</li>
        <li>deglazing liquid - such as whisky or beer</li>
        <li>1 litre veg/chicken stock</li>
        <li>Toppings - such as chicken, andouille, smoky mushrooms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rough dice pepper, onion and celery, finely mince garlic and carrot</li>
        <li>Add oil to pan, get nice and hot, add flour and immediately begin whisking. Keep it on a medium-high heat and whisk <strong>continuously</strong>. Keep going to chocolatey colour and a nice nutty aroma - about 10 mins if hot enough</li>
        <li>Add onion, pepper and celery (trinity) and carrot to pan and sautee until tender-ish, Add garlic, cayenne and cajun seasoning to bloom spices </li>
        <li>Deglaze, add stock (slowly while mixing) and finally add “toppings”</li>
        <li>Simmer for <em>at least</em> an hour but ideally two to get rid of the raw flour taste and develop flavour</li>
        <li>Serve with white rice and garnish with thinly sliced spring onion</li>
    </ol>
