    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Spanakopita is one of my favourite dishes to make for pot lucks - it's easy to make, packed <em>full</em> of flavour and tastes just as good whether it's served hot or cold.</p>

    <p>This is also something that most of your friends won't have tasted before, which is good for two reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll be introducing them to something new</li>
        <li>They won't have anything to compare it to, so yours will <strong>automatically</strong> be the best they've had!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is also vegetarian, so there's less of a reason to worry about excluding those with a different dietary preference.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Makes approximately 6 party portions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>15g olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 kg frozen spinach</li>
        <li>500g feta</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of dill</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pack of filo pastry</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C</li>
        <li>Add olive oil, garlic and onion to a large saucepan and simmer until softened</li>
        <li>Add frozen spinach and simmer until excess water has been released - you may need to add some water to aid the defrosting process</li>
        <li>Once the spinach has released most of its water, remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool slightly</li>
        <li>Add the feta, dill, oregano and lemon juice</li>
        <li>Lay four or five of the filo sheets to the bottom of an oven safe dish, drizzling olive oil on each layer</li>
        <li>Add the spinach mixture to an oven safe dish and top with another four or five sheets of filo, drizzling with olive oil</li>
        <li>Add the dish to the oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until golden and crunchy</li>
    </ol>
