    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Ramen is a dish that home chefs tend to miss out on due to an "all or nothing " mindset; it's either an 18 hour slow simmered tonkotsu or a packet of instant ramen. <em>What if I told you that there's a perfect middle ground?</em></p>

    <p>This ramen recipe provides an effective template for combining a simple, but surprisingly tasty broth with homemade Ajitama egg, chashu pork, miso tare and sauteed spinach. These aren't contained within the scope of this recipe but I like to use the equilibrium method for the egg and a pressure cooker for the pork.</p>

    <p>The end result is a ramen that punches well above its weight in terms of flavour while retaining a home-cooked charm without leaving your hob on overnight! Give this a go and experiment with your own preferences.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Makes one bowl of ramen - can be scaled for more</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>400 ml <strong>hot</strong> water</li>
        <li>1 zero salt stock cube (chicken or veg)</li>
        <li>3 slices of chashu pork</li>
        <li>1 ajitama egg</li>
        <li>1 finger sized "log" of sauteed spinach</li>
        <li>80g ramen noodles</li>
        <li>4 tbsp miso tare</li>
        <li>(optional) flavouring oil - such as chilli oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare ramen noodles according to the packet instructions</li>
        <li>Combine boiling water, stock cube and miso tare - note that this can be done in the bowl or in the wok - both of which give different results in terms of presentation and flavour</li>
        <li>Once noodles are cooked, strain off water and shake forcefully to dry as much as possible</li>
        <li>Add noodles to bowl with broth, lift with chopsticks and lay down to create a "bed" for the toppings</li>
        <li>Add chashu pork, sliced ajitama egg and sauteed spinach</li>
        <li>Add flavouring oil over the top and serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
