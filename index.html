    <p>My name is Jonathan and I love cooking, I'm also an engineer so over the years that I've been cooking I've tried to find ways to make tasty dishes that are easy to make and avoid extraneous steps</p>
    <p>I like to think that my way of cooking gets 95% of the way there while expending a fraction of the effort of tracking down ingredients, using 20 dishes and obscure techniques which don't add much to the final dish</p>
    <p>The recipes linked below are some of favourites to eat for myself but also to make for other people. They scale and store well meaning that they work as make-ahead batch cooking recipes or for a dinner party</p>
